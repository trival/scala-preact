# Scala 3 Preact Bindings - Implementation Overview

## Overview

This document serves as the main index for the Scala 3 Preact bindings implementation planning. The design has been split into focused documents for easier iteration and refinement.

## Design Documents

1. **[Library General](./library-general.md)** - Core architecture, types, facades, and implementation roadmap
2. **[Component Implementation](./component-implementation.md)** - Component definition API approaches and tradeoffs
3. **[HTML DSL Design](./html-dsl-design.md)** - Laminar-inspired unified modifier API
